# MultiThreadedPrimeNumberSieves

This is a repository of files used in a project for the lancaster undergraduate research conference: 
Limiting Behaviour Of Multi-Threaded Prime Number Sieves
B. Lowe


Conference poster will be made available after 15/03/2024

To benchmark the algorithms yourself, compile Benchmark.cu. Otherwise MultiThreadedAtkin.cu and MultiThreadedDivTest.cu contain examples of prime number sieves utilising parralel PGU computing with the CUDA architecture.
